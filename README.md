The `bug.sql` file demonstrates various SQL bugs such as incorrect aggregate functions, missing joins, improper subqueries, and inappropriate column naming. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides the corrected code for each of these examples.  The goal is to highlight less frequently encountered mistakes in SQL programming to improve developer awareness and code quality.
