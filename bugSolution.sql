```sql
-- Correct use of aggregate functions with GROUP BY
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders, customer_id FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;
-- Correct join syntax with explicit JOIN condition
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name
FROM orders o JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
-- Correct subquery with proper correlation, if needed.  The below example assumes you only want the product IDs where the price is above average 
SELECT product_id FROM products WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);
-- Using descriptive column names that are not reserved keywords
CREATE TABLE users (user_id INT, user_name VARCHAR(255), user_order INT);
